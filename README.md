# Tortoise Enclosure

My mum has a problem. The problem is roughly circular shaped, with 4 legs and one head and tail sticking out of a shell. And in fact, it's even multiple problems of this type. In short, my mum has multiple tortoises and wants them to be able to enjoy summer in our garden. 

In case of her larger speciemen that's not much of a problem since a couple of years ago we added fences and low walls to our property for this exact purpose. However, there are also multiple younglings ranging from one to two year old which a) could easily get lost in the garden and b) are almost defenseless against predators suchs as wild fox, marten and even certain types of birds.

So my mum bought a [cold frame](img/enclosure_open.jpg) in which she can place them during warm weather and in a sunny spot.

One problem solved, but a new arris: These frames are not meant to be picked up and moved, therefore it is rather flimsy. So we got the idea to add a small wooden frame below for stabilization. The [cold frame](img/enclosure.jpg) has metal skirtings with screw holes in the front and back, so attachmentpoints are already in place. But just using these to connect the two frames would still be deficient. 

After I took a closer look, I discovered the cold frame corners where (barely) held together by [triangles with slots](img/original_part.jpg). Using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) I designed a [similar part](img/version_1_tinkercad.png) which would extend across both frames. Because of the huge overhangs I used an [Anycubic Photon S](https://www.anycubic.com/collections/anycubic-photon-3d-printers/products/anycubic-photon-s) instead of my [FlyingBear Ghost 5](https://github.com/saenglert/ghost5) to 3D print the part. The [print](img/version_1_front.jpg) turned out ok but was still to insecure for my taste. Furthermore, the process took 7 h to complete for a single corner which I reconned I could cut down by adjusting the design to require less support material and print on the Ghost 5.

Enter [Version 3](img/version_3_front.jpg) [^1] which takes close to 3 h to print and [fits (almost) snug with the wooden profile](img/close_enough.jpg). As one of my favourite saying goes: Close enough for government work. The [finished enclosure](img/finished_enclosure_overview.jpg) is now [firmly held together](img/finished_enclosure_detail.jpg) and ready for its inhabitants.
